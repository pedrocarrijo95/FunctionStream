/**
* A bucket is a container for storing objects in a compartment within a namespace. A bucket is associated with a single compartment.
* The compartment has policies that indicate what actions a user can perform on a bucket and all the objects in the bucket. For more
* information, see [Managing Buckets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Object/Tasks/managingbuckets.htm).
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
