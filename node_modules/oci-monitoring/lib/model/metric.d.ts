 * Monitoring API
 * Use the Monitoring API to manage metric queries and alarms for assessing the health, capacity, and performance of your cloud resources.
Endpoints vary by operation. For PostMetric, use the `telemetry-ingestion` endpoints; for all other operations, use the `telemetry` endpoints.
For information about monitoring, see [Monitoring Overview](/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm).
