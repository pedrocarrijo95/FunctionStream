 * An OCI DNS resolver. If the resolver has an attached VCN then the VCN will attempt to answer queries based on the
 * attached views in priority order. If the query does not match any of the attached views then the query will be
 * evaluated against the default view. If the default view does not match then the rules will be evaluated in
 * priority order. If no rules match the query then answers come from Internet DNS. A resolver may have at most 10
 * resolver endpoints.
