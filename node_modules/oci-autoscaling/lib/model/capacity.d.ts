 * Autoscaling API
 * APIs for dynamically scaling Compute resources to meet application requirements. For more information about
autoscaling, see [Autoscaling](/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm). For information about the
Compute service, see [Overview of the Compute Service](/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm).

**Note:** Autoscaling is not available in US Government Cloud tenancies. For more information, see
[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure US Government Cloud](/Content/General/Concepts/govoverview.htm).
