 * Autoscaling API
 * APIs for dynamically scaling Compute resources to meet application requirements. For more information about
autoscaling, see [Autoscaling](/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm). For information about the
Compute service, see [Overview of the Compute Service](/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm).

**Note:** Autoscaling is not available in US Government Cloud tenancies. For more information, see

* Autoscaling policies define the criteria that trigger autoscaling actions and the actions to take.
* <p>
An autoscaling policy is part of an autoscaling configuration. For more information, see
* [Autoscaling](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm).
* <p>
You can create the following types of autoscaling policies:
*
*   - **Schedule-based:** Autoscaling events take place at the specific times that you schedule.
*   - **Threshold-based:** An autoscaling action is triggered when a performance metric meets or exceeds a threshold.
