      * The template text of the custom protection rule. All custom protection rules are expressed in ModSecurity Rule Language.
  * <p>
  Additionally, each rule must include two placeholder variables that are updated by the WAF service upon publication of the rule.
  * <p>
  `id: {{id_1}}` - This field is populated with a unique rule ID generated by the WAF service which identifies a `SecRule`. More than one `SecRule` can be defined in the `template` field of a CreateCustomSecurityRule call. The value of the first `SecRule` must be `id: {{id_1}}` and the `id` field of each subsequent `SecRule` should increase by one, as shown in the example.
  * <p>
  `ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}}` - The action to be taken when the criteria of the `SecRule` are met, either `OFF`, `DETECT` or `BLOCK`. This field is automatically populated with the corresponding value of the `action` field of the `CustomProtectionRuleSetting` schema when the `WafConfig` is updated.
  * <p>
  *Example:*
  *   ```
  *   SecRule REQUEST_COOKIES \"regex matching SQL injection - part 1/2\" \\
  *           \"phase:2,                                                 \\
  *           msg:'Detects chained SQL injection attempts 1/2.',        \\
  *           id: {{id_1}},                                             \\
  *           ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}},                                  \\
  *           deny\"
  *   SecRule REQUEST_COOKIES \"regex matching SQL injection - part 2/2\" \\
  *           \"phase:2,                                                 \\
  *           msg:'Detects chained SQL injection attempts 2/2.',        \\
  *           id: {{id_2}},                                             \\
  *           ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}},                                  \\
  *           deny\"
  *   ```
  * <p>
  
  * The example contains two `SecRules` each having distinct regex expression to match the `Cookie` header value during the second input analysis phase.
