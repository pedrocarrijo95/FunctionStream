  Reserved public IP addresses are IP addresses that are registered using the virtual cloud network API.
  * <p>
  Create a reserved public IP address. When you create the network load balancer, enter the OCID of the reserved public IP address in the
  * reservedIp field to attach the IP address to the network load balancer. This task configures the network load balancer to listen to traffic on this IP address.
  * <p>
  Reserved public IP addresses are not deleted when the network load balancer is deleted. The IP addresses become unattached from the network load balancer.
  * <p>
  Example: \"ocid1.publicip.oc1.phx.unique_ID\"
