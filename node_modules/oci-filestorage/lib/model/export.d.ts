/**
* A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
* resource belongs to exactly one export set.
* <p>
The export's path attribute is not a path in the
* referenced file system, but the value used by clients for the path
* component of the remotetarget argument when mounting the file
* system.
* <p>
The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more
* slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with
* the same export set, except those in a 'DELETED' state, the path element
* sequence for the first export resource can't contain the
* complete path element sequence of the second export resource.
* <p>

* For example, the following are acceptable:
* <p>
  * /example and /path
*   * /example1 and /example2
*   * /example and /example1
* <p>
The following examples are not acceptable:
*   * /example and /example/path
*   * / and /example
* <p>
Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.)
* or two periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.
* <p>
No two non-'DELETED' export resources in the same export set can
* reference the same file system.
* <p>
Use `exportOptions` to control access to an export. For more information, see
* [Export Options](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/File/Tasks/exportoptions.htm).
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

export interface Export {
    /**
      * Policies that apply to NFS requests made through this
  * export. `exportOptions` contains a sequential list of
  * `ClientOptions`. Each `ClientOptions` item defines the
  * export options that are applied to a specified
  * set of clients.
  * <p>
  For each NFS request, the first `ClientOptions` option
  * in the list whose `source` attribute matches the source
  * IP address of the request is applied.
  * <p>
  If a client source IP address does not match the `source`
  * property of any `ClientOptions` in the list, then the
  * export will be invisible to that client. This export will
  * not be returned by `MOUNTPROC_EXPORT` calls made by the client
  * and any attempt to mount or access the file system through
  * this export will result in an error.
  * <p>
  **Exports without defined `ClientOptions` are invisible to all clients.**
  * <p>
  If one export is invisible to a particular client, associated file
  * systems may still be accessible through other exports on the same
  * or different mount targets.
  * To completely deny client access to a file system, be sure that the client
  * source IP address is not included in any export for any mount target
  * associated with the file system.
