/**
 * The InnoDB shutdown mode. If the value is \"SLOW\", InnoDB does a slow
* shutdown, a full purge and a change buffer merge before shutting
* down. If the value is \"FAST\", InnoDB skips these operations at shutdown,
* a process known as a fast shutdown. If the value is \"IMMEDIATE\", InnoDB
* flushes its logs and shuts down cold, as if MySQL had crashed; no
* committed transactions are lost, but the crash recovery operation makes
* the next startup take longer.
* <p>
The slow shutdown can take minutes, or even hours in extreme cases where
* substantial amounts of data are still buffered. Use the slow shutdown
* technique before upgrading or downgrading between MySQL major releases,
* so that all data files are fully prepared in case the upgrade process
* updates the file format.
