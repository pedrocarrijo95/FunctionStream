      * A filter that specifies the event that will trigger actions associated with this rule. A few
  * important things to remember about filters:
  * <p>
  * Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create a valid filter that matches
  * all events with two curly brackets: `{}`
  * <p>
    For more examples, see
  * [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm).
  * * For a condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all the field names
  * listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting
  * structure used in the event.
  * <p>
    For a list of reference events, see
  * [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm).
  * * Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments.
  * This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in
  * the compartment or any of its child compartments.
  * * Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (*) character.
  * <p>
    For examples of wildcard matching, see
  * [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm)
  * <p>
  Example: `\\\"eventType\\\": \\\"com.oraclecloud.databaseservice.autonomous.database.backup.end\\\"`
