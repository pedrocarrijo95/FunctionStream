/**
 * Application Migration API
 * Application Migration simplifies the migration of applications from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
You can use Application Migration API to migrate applications, such as Oracle Java Cloud Service, SOA Cloud Service, and Integration Classic
instances, to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For more information, see
[Overview of Application Migration](/iaas/application-migration/appmigrationoverview.htm).
