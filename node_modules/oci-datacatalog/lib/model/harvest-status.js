/**
 * Harvest state of the object indicates the completeness of the metadata definition of the object in the catalog.
 * COMPLETE   - The object's metadata is harvested successfully including properties, relationships, and its children.
 * ERROR      - There is an error during the harvest process. This could be due to failure in the harvest process, or
 *              invalid or currupted data.
 * IN-PROGRESS - The harvest is currently in progress. This might imply a successful shallow harvest and a deep harvest
 *              is currently in progress.
 * DEFERRED   - The dependencies are incomplete and the resolution of the metadata is deferred until all information
 *              is available for the object.
