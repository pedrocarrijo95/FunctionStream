 * An object representing an updated list of network security groups (NSGs) that overwrites the existing list of NSGs.
 * *  If the load balancer has no NSGs configured, it uses the NSGs in this list.
 * *  If the load balancer has a list of NSGs configured, this list replaces the existing list.
 * *  If the load balancer has a list of NSGs configured and this list is empty, the operation removes all of the load balancer's NSG associations.

  The benefits of associating the load balancer with NSGs include:
  * <p>
  *  NSGs define network security rules to govern ingress and egress traffic for the load balancer.
  * <p>
  *  The network security rules of other resources can reference the NSGs associated with the load balancer
  *    to ensure access.
