/**
 * An object that represents the action of adding a header to a response.
 * This rule applies only to HTTP listeners.
 * <p>
 **NOTES:**
 * <p>
 *  If a matching header already exists in the response, the system removes all of its occurrences, and then adds the
 *    new header.
 * <p>
 *  The system does not distinquish between underscore and dash characters in headers. That is, it treats
 *   `example_header_name` and `example-header-name` as identical. Oracle recommends that you do not rely on underscore
 *   or dash characters to uniquely distinguish header names.
