* An object that represents the action of removing a header from a response. This rule applies only to HTTP listeners.
* <p>
If the same header appears more than once in the response, the load balancer removes all occurances of the specified header.
* <p>
**Note:** The system does not distinquish between underscore and dash characters in headers. That is, it treats
* `example_header_name` and `example-header-name` as identical. Oracle recommends that you do not rely on underscore
* or dash characters to uniquely distinguish header names.
